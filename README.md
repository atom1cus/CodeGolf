# Code Golf

This repository contins solutions for Grammarly Tech Challenge on [JEEConf 2018](https://jeeconf.com/).

### Task description:
Recently, Java moved to 6-month release cadence. The task isto print the Java releases timeline — up to JDK 42 in March 2034. This is "code golf", so the shortest code wins (we count only non-whitespace characters). 

Bring your laptop to the Grammarly booth and show your working code to our team. The competetion ends on May 19th at 15:30.

### Output example:
```
JDK 1.0 was released in January 1996
JDK 1.1 was released in February 1997
JDK 1.2 was released in December 1998
JDK 1.3 was released in May 2000
JDK 1.4 was released in February 2002
JDK 5 was released in September 2004
JDK 6 was released in December 2006
JDK 7 was released in July 2011
JDK 8 was released in March 2014
JDK 9 was released in September 2017
JDK 10 was released in March 2018
JDK 11 will be released in September 2018
JDK 12 will be released in March 2019
JDK 13 will be released in September 2019
JDK 14 will be released in March 2020
```
**... //print all lines between JDK 14 and 42 too**
```
JDK 42 will be released in SEPTEMBER 2034
```

### The rules:
* Use any JVM language. All languages compete separatly: jav, Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, Clojure, JRuby — whatever you feel lucky about.
* You can submit many programs.
* New lines must be preserved but the casing is optional.
* In runtime, your code should not depend on external services or libraries (except for the standard library for your language).
* The judges will try to resolve fairly any disputes and ambiguities.
